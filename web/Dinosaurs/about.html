Dinosaurs many years ago. Around 1000 species of dinosaurs have been identified from fossil records. Most species became extinct in a cataclysmic extinction event.

Dinosaurs were lizard-like creatures (but they were not lizards). Some dinosaur species were huge, reaching lengths of over 50 metres and heights of over 9 metres. However many dinosaurs were quite small at only about 50 cm long. Some dinosaur species walked on two legs, whilst others used four. Many species had horns or crests, whilst others had bony armour and spines. Dinosaurs commonly built nests and laid eggs. 

New discoveries have found blood cells, DNA and unfossilised dinosaur tissue.
