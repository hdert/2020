Relative to the large and powerful hind-limbs, Tyrannosaurus forelimbs were small but still powerful. Tyrannosaurus was the one of the largest known land predators, growing over 12 metres in length and weighing almost 7 tonnes. What is not commonly known is the Tyrannosaurus teeth were 6 inches long, but only had shallow roots in the gums, so may not have been capable of eating solid meat.</td>
