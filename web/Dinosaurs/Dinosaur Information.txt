Dinosaurs
---------------------

Dinosaurs many years ago. Around 1000 species of dinosaurs have been identified from fossil records. Most species became extinct in a cataclysmic extinction event.

Dinosaurs were lizard-like creatures (but they were not lizards). Some dinosaur species were huge, reaching lengths of over 50 metres and heights of over 9 metres. However many dinosaurs were quite small at only about 50 cm long. Some dinosaur species walked on two legs, whilst others used four. Many species had horns or crests, whilst others had bony armour and spines. Dinosaurs commonly built nests and laid eggs. 

New discoveries have found blood cells, DNA and unfossilised dinosaur tissue.


Tyrannosaurus
----------------------
Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to the large and powerful hind-limbs, Tyrannosaurus forelimbs were small but still powerful. Tyrannosaurus was the one of the largest known land predators, growing over 12 metres in length and weighing almost 7 tonnes. What is not commonly known is the Tyrannosaurus teeth were 6 inches long, but only had shallow roots in the gums, so may not have been capable of eating solid meat. 


Velociraptor
----------------------
Velociraptor was a bipedal, carnivore with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hind-foot, which is thought to have been used to kill its prey.


Triceretops
----------------------
Triceratops was a herbivorous dinosaur. Bearing a large bony frill and three horns on its large four-legged body, Triceratops is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs. It shared the landscape with and was preyed upon by the fearsome Tyrannosaurus.


Brachiosaurus
----------------------
Brachiosaurus had a proportionally long neck, small skull, and large overall size. Brachiosaurus was a herbivore and it is regarded as a high browser, probably cropping or nipping vegetation as high as 9 metres off of the ground.


Archaeopteryx
----------------------
Archaeopteryx could grow to about 0.5 m in length. The body and forelimbs of Archaeopteryx were covered in feathers, which were just like modern bird feathers.

Pterodactyl
----------------------
Pterodactyl was a flying carnivore and probably preyed upon fish and other small animals. The wings of Pterodactylus were formed by a skin and muscle membrane stretching from its elongated fourth finger to its hind limbs.
