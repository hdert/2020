            <p>Some believe the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event was a mass extinction of some three-quarters of plant and animal species on Earth including all dinosaurs. </p>
            <p>
            Some believe that the extinction was triggered by a massive comet/asteroid impact and its catastrophic effects on the global environment and weather.
