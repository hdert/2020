Mount Maunganui, or Mauao as it has long been known to the Maori people, is a place steeped in history and culture. Situated at the eastern entrance of Tauranga Harbour it is the most sacred landmark in the Tauranga area and has significant historical value. Mauao was once an extensive Maori settlement, traces of which (in the form of terracing, embankments and middens) can still be seen by visitors who climb to the top to take in the spectacular views.

During the past two centuries the good weather, great beaches, fertile land and excellent harbour have attracted more and more settlers to the region. Their history can also be seen in and around The Mount. A number of museums and collections offer visitors a glimpse into the past.
