The Mount has a wide range of relaxing activities for you to enjoy. Relaxing on the beach is just one option, with the sunshine and sandy beaches providing the perfect setting to unwind. Or head to one of the many restaurants and cafes for a great meal.

If you really need to wind-down, spend a day at the hot water pools, or at one of the luxury spas near the town. Soaking in thermal spring water is a great way to relax after a hard day at the beach or shopping! Just a few kilometers away you can visit local wineries and sample their excellent wines.
