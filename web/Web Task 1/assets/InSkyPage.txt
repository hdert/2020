For the best views of Mount Maunganui, you can't get better than a scenic flight. These offer sights of Mauao, Tauranga city and the surrounding beaches and islands

If you're feeling a bit more adventurous you can opt to parasail from the top of Mauao (tandem flights with a qualified instructor are available!)
