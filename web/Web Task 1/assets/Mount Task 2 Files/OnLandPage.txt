Climbing Mount Maunganui is a fantastic experience. It will take you around 30-40 minutes to reach the summit along well maintained, wide paths. Have a picnic at the top (there are picnic tables on the summit) whilst enjoying the breathtaking views over the town, harbour and coastline below.

The town of Mount Maunganui at the foot of Mauao offers a wide range of experiences, with excellent shopping, great cafes and a number of parks. Further afield many other activities can be found.
