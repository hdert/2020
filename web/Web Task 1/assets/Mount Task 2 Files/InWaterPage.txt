If you like to get off the beach and into the ocean, The Mount offers plenty to do. The sea is warm during the summer months, and the beach has one of the best surf breaks in the region, attracting surfers and body-boarders from near and far.

Below the ocean waves there exists an abundance of marine life, including many marine mammals. Large groups of dolphins are regularly sighted off of the Mount Maunganui coast, and organised trips are available to take you to see these graceful creatures, and even swim with them.
