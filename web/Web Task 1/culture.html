                <h2>Culture at the Mount</h2>

                <p>Mount Maunganui, or Mauao as it has long been known to the Maori people, is a place steeped in
                    history and culture. Situated at the eastern entrance of Tauranga Harbour it is the most sacred
                    landmark in the Tauranga area and has significant historical value. Mauao was once an extensive
                    Maori settlement, traces of which (in the form of terracing, embankments and middens) can still be
                    seen by visitors who climb to the top to take in the spectacular views.</p>

                <p>During the past two centuries the good weather, great beaches, fertile land and excellent harbour
                    have attracted more and more settlers to the region. Their history can also be seen in and around
                    The Mount. A number of museums and collections offer visitors a glimpse into the past.</p>
