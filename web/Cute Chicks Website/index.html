                <p>We have a passion for fancy chickens - chickens bred for their beautiful plummage and colouring. For
                    the past 30 years we have breed some of the best-looking chickens in the country. We take pride in
                    our chickens and now want you to share our them with you. We are now selling eggs, chicks and
                    chickens. You too can own some of these wonderful creatures.</p>

                    beautiful chickens that we breed. Just look at them... they are gorgeous, aren't they?!</p>
